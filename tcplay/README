tcplay (Free TrueCrypt implementation)

tcplay is a free  (BSD-licensed) and stable TrueCrypt implementation.
This implementation supports mapping (opening) both system and normal
TrueCrypt volumes, as well as opening  hidden  volumes and opening an
outer volume  while protecting a hidden volume. There is also support
to create volumes, including hidden volumes, change passphrase, etc.
