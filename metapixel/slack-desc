# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

metapixel:
metapixel: Metapixel is a program for generating photomosaics.  It can  generate
metapixel: classical photomosaics,  in  which the source image  is  viewed  as a
metapixel: matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which a matching image
metapixel: is  substitued,  as  well  as  collage-style  photomosaics,  in which 
metapixel: rectangular  parts of the source image  at  arbitrary  positions  are
metapixel: substituted by matching images.
