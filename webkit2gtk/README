WebKit2GTK+ (GTK+ port of the WebKit2)

WebKitGTK+ is the port of the portable web rendering engine WebKit2 to
the GTK+ platform. Since adding  support for WebKit2, itâ€™s possible to
build applications that use the web  platform with increased  security
and  responsiveness.  The web is a jungle,  but web pages cannot crash
the  main  applicationor  freeze the UI.  WebKitGTK+ also uses process
separation to seamlessly support GTK+2 plugins ( like Flash ) in GTK+3
applications.
