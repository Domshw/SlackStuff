# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

shc: shc (Shell script compiler)
shc:
shc: A generic shell script compiler.  Shc takes a script, which is
shc: specified on the command line and produces C source code.  The
shc: generated source code is then compiled and linked to produce a
shc: stripped binary executable. Use with care.
