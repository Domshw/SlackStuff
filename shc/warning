The compiled binary will still be  dependent  on  the  shell
specified  in  the  first  line  of  the  shell  code  (i.e.
#!/bin/sh), thus shc does not create completely  independent
binaries.

shc itself is not a compiler such as cc, it  rather  encodes
and encrypts a shell script and generates C source code with
the added expiration capability. It  then  uses  the  system
compiler  to compile a stripped binary which behaves exactly
like the  original  script.  Upon  execution,  the  compiled
binary  will  decrypt and execute the code with the shell -c
option.  Unfortunatelly, it will  not  give  you  any  speed
improvement as a real C program would.

shc's main purpose is to protect  your  shell  scripts  from
modification  or  inspection.  You can use it if you wish to
distribute your scripts but don't want  them  to  be  easily
readable by other people.
