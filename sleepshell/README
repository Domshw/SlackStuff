SleepShell (Dummy Shell)

This is a simple  do-nothing,  sleep-forever  program that can be used
as a login shell  (in Linux or Unix)  to keep the  connection open but
without interactive shell.  We use it to create SSH accounts for users
who will only use them for SSH-tunneling to create an encrypted tunnel
to  our  servers  (for example to connect securely to database servers
like mySQL, PostgreSQL, etc).
