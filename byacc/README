byacc (Berkeley Yacc parser generator)

Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator. Berkeley Yacc
has  been  made  as  compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc.
Berkeley  Yacc  can  accept  any  input specification  that
conforms  to  the  AT&T Yacc  documentation. Specifications
that take advantage  of  undocumented features of AT&T Yacc
will probably be rejected.

In order not to conflict with the bison package  that ships
with Slackware, the executable will install as byacc.
