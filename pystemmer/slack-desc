# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pystemmer: pystemmer (Snowball stemming algorithms for information retrieval)
pystemmer:
pystemmer: PyStemmer provides access to efficient  algorithms for calculating a
pystemmer: "stemmed" form  of a word.  This is  a form  with most of the common
pystemmer: morphological  endings  removed;  hopefully  representing  a  common
pystemmer: linguistic base form. This is most useful in building search engines
pystemmer: and information retrieval software.
