pystemmer (Snowball stemming algorithms for information retrieval)

PyStemmer provides access to efficient  algorithms for calculating a
"stemmed" form  of a word.  This is  a form  with most of the common
morphological  endings  removed;  hopefully  representing  a  common
linguistic base form. This is most useful in building search engines
and information retrieval software.
