webrtc-audio-processing (WebRTC audio-processing library)

This is meant to be a more  Linux 'packaging friendly' copy of the
AudioProcessing library based on Google's implementation of WebRTC
(Web-based Real-Time Communication) that enables web browsers with
Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities  via simple Javascript
APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this
purpose and implements the  W3C's proposal for video  conferencing
on the web.
