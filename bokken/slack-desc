# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bokken: bokken (GUI for Pyew and Radare2)
bokken:
bokken: Bokken is a GUI for the Pyew and Radare projects so it offers almost
bokken: all the same features that Pyew has and *some* of the Radare's ones.
bokken: It's intended to be a basic disassembler, mainly, to analyze malware
bokken: and  vulnerabilities.   Currently Bokken is  neither an  hexadecimal
bokken: editor nor a full featured  disassembler *YET*,  so it should not be
bokken: used for deep code analysis or to try to modify files with it.
