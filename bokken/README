bokken (GUI for Pyew and Radare2)

Bokken is a GUI for the Pyew and Radare projects so it offers almost
all the same features that Pyew has and *some* of the Radare's ones.
It's intended to be a basic disassembler, mainly, to analyze malware
and  vulnerabilities.   Currently Bokken is  neither an  hexadecimal
editor nor a full featured  disassembler *YET*,  so it should not be
used for deep code analysis or to try to modify files with it.
