veracrypt (disk encryption software based on TrueCrypt)

VeraCrypt adds enhanced security to the algorithms used for system
and partitions encryption making it immune to  new developments in
brute-force  attacks.  It  also  solves  many  vulnerabilities and
security issues found in TrueCrypt. Starting from version 1.0f, it
can load  TrueCrypt volume  and offers the  possibility to convert
TrueCrypt containers and non-system partitions to VeraCrypt format.
