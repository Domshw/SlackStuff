zimg (Scaling, colorspace conversion, and dithering library)

The "z" library implements the commonly required  image  processing
basics of scaling,  colorspace conversion,  and depth conversion. A
'simple API' enables conversion between any supported formats.  All
library routines were designed from the ground-up with flexibility,
thread safety, and correctness as first priorities.
