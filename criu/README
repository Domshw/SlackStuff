criu (Checkpoint and Restore in Userspace)

An utility to checkpoint/restore tasks.  Using this tool, you can
freeze a running application (or part of it) and checkpoint it to
a hard drive as a collection of files. You can then use the files
to restore and run the application at the point it was frozen.
The distinctive feature  of the CRIU project is that it is mainly
implemented in user space.
