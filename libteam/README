libteam (Library for controlling team network device)

The purpose of the Team driver is to provide a  mechanism to team
multiple NICs (ports) into one logical one (teamdev) at L2 layer.
The  process  is  called  "channel bonding",  "Ethernet bonding",
"channel teaming", "link aggregation", etc.  It is implemented in
the Linux kernel by the bonding driver.
