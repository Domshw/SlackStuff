# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ttfautohint: Hinting TrueType fonts can be a slow and expensive process,  and
ttfautohint: many fonts lack good hinting totally  because they are converted
ttfautohint: to TrueType  from  another font format.  ttfautohint solves this
ttfautohint: by  building  on FreeType's  autohinting  system.  It brings the
ttfautohint: excellent quality of FreeType rendering to platforms which don't
ttfautohint: use FreeType, yet require hinting for text to look good.
