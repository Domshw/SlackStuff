ttfautohint (Automated hinting process for web fonts)

Hinting TrueType fonts can be a slow and expensive process,  and
many fonts lack good hinting totally  because they are converted
to TrueType  from  another font format.  ttfautohint solves this
by  building  on FreeType's  autohinting  system.  It brings the
excellent quality of FreeType rendering to platforms which don't
use FreeType, yet require hinting for text to look good.
