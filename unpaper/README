unpaper (A post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper)

`unpaper` is a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper,
especially for book pages that have been scanned from previously
created  photocopies. `unpaper` tries to clean scanned images by
removing dark edges that appeared through scanning or copying on
areas outside the actual page content  (e.g.  dark areas between
the  left-hand-side  and  the  right-hand-side of a double-sided
book-page scan). The main purpose is  to make scanned book pages
better readable on screen after conversion to PDF.
