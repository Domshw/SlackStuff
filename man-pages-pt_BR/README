man-pages-pt_BR (localized system documentation)

Man pages are online documentation for Linux.  This package includes
localized sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 man pages for Linux.

The man-pages distribution is maintained by several people, who hold
copyright for these pages, but everything published under the LDP-BR
seems to be released under GPL.
