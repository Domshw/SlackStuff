gdata (API to Google services)

The Google Data APIs  (Google Data)  provide a simple protocol for
reading and writing data on the web.  Though it is possible to use
these services  with a simple  HTTP client,  this library provides
helpful tools to streamline your code and keep up with server-side
changes.
