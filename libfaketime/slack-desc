# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

faketime: faketime (Modifies the system time for a single application)
faketime:
faketime: libfaketime intercepts various system calls  which programs use to
faketime: retrieve the current date and time. It can then report faked dates
faketime: and times (as specified by you, the user) to these programs.  This
faketime: means you can modify the system time a program sees without having
faketime: to change the time system-wide.
