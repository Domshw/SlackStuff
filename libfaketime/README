faketime (Modifies the system time for a single application)

libfaketime intercepts various system calls  which programs use to
retrieve the current date and time. It can then report faked dates
and times (as specified by you, the user) to these programs.  This
means you can modify the system time a program sees without having
to change the time system-wide.
