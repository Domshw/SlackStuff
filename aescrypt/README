AES Crypt is a file encryption software that uses the industry
standard Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to easily and securely
encrypt files. Using a powerful 256-bit encryption algorithm, AES
Crypt can safely secure your most sensitive files. Once a file is
encrypted, you do not have to worry about a person reading your
sensitive information, as an encrypted file is  completely useless
without the password. It simply cannot be read.
