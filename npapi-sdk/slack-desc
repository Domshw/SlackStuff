# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

npapi-sdk: npapi-sdk (Netscape Plugin API)
npapi-sdk:
npapi-sdk: NPAPI-SDK is a bundle of  NPAPI  headers by Mozilla. This project aims
npapi-sdk: to sort out and package that bundle for nix systems, providing a clear
npapi-sdk: way to install those headers and depend on them.  Unlike Mozilla, this
npapi-sdk: project is never going to change its API *without* bumping version. If
npapi-sdk: necessary, third version component will be added for that reason.
