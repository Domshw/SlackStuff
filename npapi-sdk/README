npapi-sdk (Netscape Plugin API)

NPAPI-SDK is a bundle of  NPAPI  headers by Mozilla. This project aims
to sort out and package that bundle for nix systems, providing a clear
way to install those headers and depend on them.  Unlike Mozilla, this
project is never going to change its API *without* bumping version. If
necessary, third version component will be added for that reason.
