BTFS (bittorrent filesystem)

With BTFS, you can mount any '.torrent' file or 'magnet link' and then use
it as any read-only directory in your file tree. The contents of the files
will be downloaded on-demand as they are read by applications.  Tools like
ls, cat and cp works as expected. Vlc and mplayer can also work.
