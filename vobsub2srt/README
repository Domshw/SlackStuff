vobsub2srt (Convert idx/sub subtitles into srt text subtitles)

VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert .idx/.sub
subtitles into .srt text subtitles by using OCR.  It is based on
code from the MPlayer project.  Some minor parts are copied from
ffmpeg/avutil headers. Tesseract is used as OCR software.
