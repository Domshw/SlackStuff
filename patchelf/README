patchelf (A small utility to modify ELF binaries)

PatchELF is a simple utility for modifing existing  ELF executables
and libraries. It can change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter")
of executables,  change and/or remove the RPATH of executables  and
libraries and remove declared  (DT_NEEDED entries)  dependencies on
dynamic libraries.
