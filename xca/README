xca (X Certificate and Key Management)

This application is intended for creating and managing  X.509 certificates,
certificate requests,  RSA,  DSA and EC private keys,  Smartcards and CRLs.
Everything that is needed for a CA is implemented. All CAs can sign sub-CAs
recursively. These certificate chains are shown clearly.

For an easy  company-wide use there are customiseable templates that can be
used for certificate or request generation. All crypto data is stored in an
endian-agnostic file format portable across operating systems.
