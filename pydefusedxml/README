defusedxml (XML bomb protection for Python)

defusedxml - defusing XML bombs and other exploits. The results of an
attack on a vulnerable XML library can be fairly dramatic. With a few
hundred Bytes of XML data an attacker can occupy several Gigabytes of
memory within seconds. An attacker can also keep CPUs busy for a long
time with a small to medium size request or even access files on your
server.
