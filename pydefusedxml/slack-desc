# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pydefusedxml: defusedxml (XML bomb protection for Python)
pydefusedxml:
pydefusedxml: defusedxml - defusing XML bombs and other exploits. The results of an
pydefusedxml: attack on a vulnerable XML library can be fairly dramatic. With a few
pydefusedxml: hundred Bytes of XML data an attacker can occupy several Gigabytes of
pydefusedxml: memory within seconds. An attacker can also keep CPUs busy for a long
pydefusedxml: time with a small to medium size request or even access files on your
pydefusedxml: server.
