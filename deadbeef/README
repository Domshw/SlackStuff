DeaDBeeF (as in 0xDEADBEEF) is an audio player for GNU/Linux,
*BSD, OpenSolaris and other UNIX-like systems. There's also
the Android version, which is a very different product.
There are no Windows, OSX or iOS versions.

This build depends on ffmpeg-compat.

deadbeef 0.6.0 fixed compatibility with FFMPEG up to 2.0.2
