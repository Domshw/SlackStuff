twister (p2p microblogging)

Twister is an experimental peer-to-peer microblogging software.
User registration and authentication is provided by a  bitcoin-
like network, so it is completely distributed  (does not depend
on any central authority).  Post distribution uses kademlia DHT
network and bittorrent-like swarms, both provided by libtorrent.
