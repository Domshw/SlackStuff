kiwi (A framework for developing graphical applications in Python)

Kiwi is a framework  composed of a set of modules,  which eases Python
development  using  PyGTK.  Kiwi makes  graphical applications  *much*
faster to code,  with good architecture and more Python-like bindings;
it also offers extended widgets based upon the original PyGTK widgets.
