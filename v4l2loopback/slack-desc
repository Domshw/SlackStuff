# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

v4l2loopback: v4l2loopback (A kernel module to create V4L2 loopback devices)
v4l2loopback:
v4l2loopback: This module allows you to create "virtual video devices". Normal v4l2
v4l2loopback: applications will read these devices as if they were "ordinary video"
v4l2loopback: devices,  but the video will not be read from e.g. a capture card but
v4l2loopback: instead it is generated by another application.
