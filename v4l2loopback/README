v4l2loopback (A kernel module to create V4L2 loopback devices)

This module allows you to create "virtual video devices". Normal v4l2
applications will read these devices as if they were "ordinary video"
devices,  but the video will not be read from e.g. a capture card but
instead it is generated by another application.
