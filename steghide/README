Steghide (steganography program)

Steghide is a steganography  program that is able to
hide data in various kinds of image and audio-files.
The  color-sample-frequencies are not changed,  thus
making the  embedding  resistant against first-order
statistical tests.

Features:
*-encryption of embedded data
*-compression of embedded data
*-embedding of a checksum to verify the integrity of
  the extraced data
*-support for JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU files
