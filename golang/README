golang (Google's Go programming language kit)

The  Go  programming  language  is  an  open source  project to make
programmers more  productive.  Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
