hwloc (Portable hardware locality)

hwloc provides  command line tools and a C API to obtain the  hierarchical map
of  key  computing  elements,  such  as:  NUMA  memory  nodes,  shared caches,
processor sockets, processor cores,  processing  units  (logical processors or
"threads")  and  even I/O devices.  hwloc also gathers various attributes such
as cache and memory information, and is portable across a variety of different
operating systems and platforms.
