libpng14 (Portable Network Graphics library 1.4 series)

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for the
lossless,  portable,  well-compressed storage of raster images.  PNG
provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many
common uses of TIFF.  Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images
are supported,  plus an optional alpha channel.  Sample depths range
from 1 to 16 bits.
