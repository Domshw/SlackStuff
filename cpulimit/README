cpulimit is  a simple  program which  attempts to limit the cpu
usage of a process  (expressed in percentage, not in cpu time).
This is useful to control batch jobs,  when you don't want them
to eat too much cpu. It does not act on the nice value or other
scheduling priority stuff, but on the real cpu usage.  Also, it
is able to adapt itself to the overall system load, dynamically
and quickly.
