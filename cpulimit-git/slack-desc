# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

cpulimit: to eat too much cpu. It does not act on the nice value or other
cpulimit: scheduling priority stuff, but on the real cpu usage.  Also, it
cpulimit: is able to adapt itself to the overall system load, dynamically
