Limit CPU Usage Per Process

Examples of use
---------------

Limit the process 'bigloop' by executable name to 40% CPU:

    cpulimit --exe=bigloop --limit=40
    cpulimit --exe=/usr/local/bin/bigloop --limit=40 

Limit a process by PID to 55% CPU:

    cpulimit --pid=2960 --limit=55 

Launch a process by command line and limit it to 40% (in development version only!):

    cpulimit --limit=40 /etc/rc.d/rc.boinc start 


Notes
-----

If your machine has one processor you can limit the  percentage from  0% to 100%,  which
means that if you set for example 50%,  your process cannot use more than  500 ms of cpu
time for each second. But if your machine has four processors,  percentage may vary from
0% to 400%, so setting the limit to 200% means to use no more than half of the available
power. In any case, the percentage is the same of what you see when you run top.

cpulimit should run at least with the same user running the controlled process. But it is
much better if you run cpulimit  as  root,  in order to have a higher priority and a more
precise control. Now cpulimit does limit also the children of the specified process.
