pexpect (Python module for spawning child applications)

Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications;  controlling them;
and responding to expected patterns in their output.  Pexpect works like Don Libes'
Expect.  Pexpect allows your script to spawn a  child application and control it as
if a _human_ were typing commands.  Pexpect can be used  for automating interactive
applications such as ssh,  ftp,  passwd,  telnet,  etc.  It can be used to automate
setup  scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers.
It can be used for automated software testing. Pexpect is pure Python.
