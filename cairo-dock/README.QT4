Cairo-Dock is an app that draws on a RGBA GLX visual.
Some users have noticed that if the dock is launched,
severals qt4-based applications,  like skype or vlc,
could crash.

If you have this problem, add the following line into
your ~/bashrc :

alias vlc='export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1; vlc; unset XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS'
