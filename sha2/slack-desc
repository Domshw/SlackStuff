# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

sha2: reads one or more files specified on the command line,  and then
sha2: generates the specified hash:  SHA-256,  SHA-384,  SHA-512  or a
