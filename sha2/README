sha2 (SHA implementation library)

sha2 is a simple program that accepts input from either STDIN or
reads one or more files specified on the command line,  and then
generates the specified hash:  SHA-256,  SHA-384,  SHA-512  or a
combination (including all at once).  The library implements the
SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 hash algorithms.
