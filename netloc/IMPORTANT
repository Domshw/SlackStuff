ATTENTION
---------

netloc and hwloc work together to  provide a comprehensive view of the
HPC system topology,  spanning from the  processor cores in one server
to the cores in another â€“ including the complex network(s) in between.
Starting  with  hwloc 2.0,  both  netloc and  hwloc are distributed in
hwloc releases.
