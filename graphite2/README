graphite2 (Rendering engine for graphite fonts)

Graphite is a  'smart font'  technology  designed to facilitate the
process known as shaping.  This process takes an input Unicode text
string and returns a sequence of positioned glyphids from the font.
Graphite2 is a reimplementation of the SIL Graphite text processing
engine, developed to support complex non-Roman writing systems.
