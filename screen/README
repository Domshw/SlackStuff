screen (screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation)

Screen is a full-screen  window  manager  that multiplexes a physical
terminal between  several processes  (typically interactive  shells).
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a  DEC VT100 terminal
and several control functions from the ISO 6492 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64)
and  ISO 2022  standards  (e.g., insert/delete line  and  support for
multiple character sets).   There is a  scrollback history buffer for
each  virtual terminal  and  a  copy-and-paste  mechanism that allows
moving text regions between windows.
