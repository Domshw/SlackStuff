gpg-crypter ( A graphical front-end to GPG[GnuPG] )

GPG-Crypter is a  graphical front-end to GnuPG (GPG) using the GTK2
toolkit and GPGME library. It has been developed to provide an easy
access to GPG encryption and decryption. It supports encryption and
decryption of text entered into the program's input fields. It also
supports file encryption and decryption.

It is first intended for encrypting text that has to be transported
over  unsecure connections like instant-messaging services.  But it
can also be  used for file  encryption and as an  easy to use email
encryption.

Further releases will offer to manage your GPG keys with an easy to
use interface. Signing of files and text will also be available.
