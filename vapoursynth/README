vapoursynth (A video processing framework)

VapourSynth is an application for video manipulation. Or a plugin. Or
a library. It’s hard to tell because it has a core library written in
C++ and a Python module to allow video scripts to be created.

The main features compared to Avisynth are:

* Multithreaded – Frame level multithreading,
* Per Frame Properties – Additional metadata can be attached to frames;
* Generalized Colorspaces – New Colorspaces can be specified at runtime;
* Python Based – The scripting part is implemented as a Python module so
  you don’t have have to learn a special language;
* Support for video with format changes – Some video just can’t stick to
  one format or frame size VapourSynth can handle any kind of change.
