Dia (A program for drawing structured diagrams)

Dia is an application for creating technical diagrams.  Its interface
and features are loosely  patterned  after the Windows program Visio.
If Features include  multiple-page  printing,  export to many formats
(EPS, SVG, CGM and PNG), and the ability to use custom shapes created
by the user as simple XML descriptions.  Dia is useful for drawing UML
diagrams, network maps, and flowcharts.
