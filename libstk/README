STK (The Synthesis ToolKit in C++)

The Synthesis ToolKit in C++  (STK)  is a set of open source audio
signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the
C++  programming  language.  STK was designed to facilitate  rapid
development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with
an  emphasis  on  cross-platform  functionality, realtime control,
ease of use, and educational example code. STK currently runs with
"realtime" support (audio and MIDI) on Linux,  Macintosh OS X, and
Windows computer platforms.
