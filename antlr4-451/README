antlr4 (Parser generator for processing structured files)

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser
generator  for  reading,  processing,  executing,  or  translating
structured  text  or  binary  files.  It's  widely  used to  build
languages, tools, and frameworks.  From a grammar, ANTLR generates
a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
