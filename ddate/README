ddate (SACRED DOCUMENT OF THE FROGS) 

ddate,  a program that prints the current date in the Discordian calendar.
It was part of the util-linux package and  at least since 1994 it had been
included in nearly all Linux distributions. In August 2011 however, one of
the maintainers of util-linux dropped it out of the main codestream.
