Pygments (syntax highlighter written in Python)

It is a  generic syntax highlighter for general use  in  all kinds of
software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need
to prettify source code.  A wide range of common languages and markup
formats is supported  and  special  attention is paid to details that
increase highlighting quality.
