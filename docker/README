docker (the Linux container engine)

Docker is an open source project to pack,  ship and run any application
as a lightweight  container.  Docker containers can run anywhere,  from
your laptop to the largest EC2  compute instance and they don't require
that you use a particular language, framework or packaging system. That
makes them great building blocks for deploying and  scaling  databases,
web apps and backend services  without  depending on a particular stack
or provider.
