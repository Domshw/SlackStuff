Libconfig is a simple library  for processing structured configuration
files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML and
unlike XML,  it is  type-aware,  so it is  not  necessary to do string
parsing in  application  code.  It is  very compact, includes bindings
for both the C/C++ languages and is well-suited for memory-constrained
systems like handheld devices.
