perl-date-manip (Date manipulation routines)

Date::Manip is a series of modules designed to make any common date
and time  operation easy to do.  Operations such  as comparing  two
times,  determining a date a given amount of time from another,  or
parsing international times are all easily done. It deals with time
as it is used in the Gregorian calendar.
