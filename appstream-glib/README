appstream-glib (GObjects and helper methods to AppStream metadata)

This library  provides GObjects  and helper methods to make it easy
to read and write AppStream metadata. It also provides a simple DOM
implementation  that makes it easy to edit nodes and convert to and
from the standardized XML representation.  It also supports reading
of Debian-style DEP-11 metadata.
