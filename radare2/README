radare2 (Portable reverse engineering framework)

r2 is a rewrite from scratch  of radare in  order to provide a set of
libraries  and tools to work with  binary files.  This is the rewrite
of radare (1.x branch) to provide a framework with a set of libraries
and  programs to  work with binary data.  Radare project started as a
forensics tool,  an scriptable commandline hexadecimal editor able to
open disk files,  but later support for analyzing binaries, debugging
programs, disassembling code, attaching to remote gdb servers...
