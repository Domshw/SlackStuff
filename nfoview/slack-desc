# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

nfoview: nfoview (NFO files viewer)
nfoview: 
nfoview: NFO Viewer is a simple viewer for NFO files, which are ASCII art in
nfoview: the CP437 codepage. The advantages of using NFO Viewer instead of a
nfoview: text editor are preset font and encoding settings, automatic window
nfoview: size and clickable hyperlinks.
