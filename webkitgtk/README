WebKitGTK+ is a port of the WebKit rendering engine, offering WebKitâ€™s
full functionality through a set of GObject-based APIs. It is suitable
for projects requiring any kind of web integration,  from hybrid HTML
applications to full-fledged web browsers, like Midori.

This builds the GTK2 and GTK3 interfaces and can be installed alongside.
