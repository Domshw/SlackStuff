# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pysetproctitle: pysetproctitle (A setproctitle implementation for Python)
pysetproctitle:
pysetproctitle: The library allows a process to change its title  (as displayed by
pysetproctitle: system tools such as 'ps' and 'top'). Changing the title is mostly
pysetproctitle: useful in multi-process systems, for example when a master process
pysetproctitle: is forked:  changing the children's title  allows to  identify the
pysetproctitle: task each process is busy with. The technique is used by PostgreSQL
pysetproctitle: and the OpenSSH Server for example.
