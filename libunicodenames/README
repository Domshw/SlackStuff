LibUnicodeNames (Unicode annotation data library)

LibUnicodeNames makes it easy for program to retrieve the information
contained in the  `names list'  file that is published by the Unicode
Consortium (http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.html). It
is  intended  to  provide  better handling of locales and replace the
libuninameslist library (http://libuninameslist.sourceforge.net/).
