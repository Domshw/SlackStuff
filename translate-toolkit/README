translate-toolkit (A toolkit to help localisations)

The Translate Toolkit is a set of software and documentation designed
to help make the lives  of localizers both  more productive  and less
frustrating.  At its core the software contains a  set of classes for
handling  various  localization  storage  formats:  DTD,  properties,
OpenOffice.org GSI/SDF,  CSV,  MO,  Qt .ts,  TMX, TBX,  WordFast txt,
Gettext .mo, Windows RC, and of course PO and XLIFF. It also provides
scripts to convert between these formats.
