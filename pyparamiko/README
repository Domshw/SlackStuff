paramiko (Python SSH module)

"paramiko" is a combination of the esperanto  words for "paranoid"
and "friend".  It's a module for python '2.6+' that implements the
SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections
to remote machines.  Unlike SSL (aka TLS),  SSH2 protocol does not
require heirarchical certificates  signed  by a  'powerful central
authority'.
