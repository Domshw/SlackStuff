python-Levenshtein (Python module for string distance calculation)

The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for fast
computation of Levenshtein (edit) distance,  edit operations,  string
similarity,  string sequence,  set similarity,  string  averaging and
approximate median strings.

Levenshtein can be used as a pure C library.  You only have to define
NO_PYTHON  preprocessor  symbol (-DNO_PYTHON) when compiling it.  The
library functionality is similar to that of the Python extension.
