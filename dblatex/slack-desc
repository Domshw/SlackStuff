# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dblatex: Dblatex tries to hide as much as possible the latex compiling stuff
dblatex: by providing a single clean script to transforms a DocBook XML/SGML
dblatex: document directly to DVI, PostScript and PDF documents.  The output
dblatex: rendering is done  not only by the XSL stylesheets  transformation,
dblatex: but also by a dedicated LaTeX package.  The goal is to allow a deep
dblatex: LaTeX customisation without changing the XSL stylesheets.
