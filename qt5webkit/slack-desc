# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

qt5webkit:
qt5webkit: WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and

qt5webkit: porting efforts Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent.
qt5webkit: QtWebKit is a project aiming at porting this fabulous engine back
