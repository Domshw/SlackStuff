Wiifuse (Mount a Gamecube or Wii DVD disc image)

Wiifuse allows you to mount a Gamecube or Wii DVD disc image as a
read-only part of the file system on you computer. This allows to
browse the directory structure and read the files within. Wiifuse
supports on-the-fly decryption for Wii encrypted partitions (need
the required 128bit AES key).
