# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pyptyprocess: ptyprocess (Python module to run a subprocess in a pseudo terminal)
pyptyprocess:
pyptyprocess: Pexpect is a Python module to launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal
pyptyprocess: (pty). Sometimes,  piping stdin and stdout is not enough.  There might
pyptyprocess: be a password prompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes
pyptyprocess: when it's  going to a _pipe_ rather  than a terminal,  or curses-style
pyptyprocess: interfaces that 'rely  on  a  terminal'. If you need to automate these
pyptyprocess: things, running the process in a pseudo terminal (pty) is the answer.
