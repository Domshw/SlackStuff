ptyprocess (Python module to run a subprocess in a pseudo terminal)

Pexpect is a Python module to launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal
(pty). Sometimes,  piping stdin and stdout is not enough.  There might
be a password prompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes
when it's  going to a _pipe_ rather  than a terminal,  or curses-style
interfaces that 'rely  on  a  terminal'. If you need to automate these
things, running the process in a pseudo terminal (pty) is the answer.
