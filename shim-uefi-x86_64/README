shim (Bootloader for x86_64 UEFI Secure Boot)

shim is a trivial EFI application that, when run, attempts to open
and execute  another application.  It will initially attempt to do
this via the standard EFI LoadImage() and  StartImage() calls.  If
these  fail  (because secure boot is enabled and the binary is not
signed with an appropriate key) it will  then validate  the binary
against a built-in certificate.
