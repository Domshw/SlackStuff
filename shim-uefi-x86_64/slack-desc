# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

shim: shim (Bootloader for x86_64 UEFI Secure Boot)
shim:
shim: shim is a trivial EFI application that, when run, attempts to open
shim: and execute  another application.  It will initially attempt to do
shim: this via the standard EFI LoadImage() and  StartImage() calls.  If
shim: these  fail  (because secure boot is enabled and the binary is not
shim: signed with an appropriate key) it will  then validate  the binary
shim: against a built-in certificate.
