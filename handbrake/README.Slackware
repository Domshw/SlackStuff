You should execute the file 'get-contrib' at least once
to populate the 'contrib/' dir and keep rebuilding when
offline. It's already triggered to run when you execute
the SlackBuild.

The script is very simple and if you remove any file from
'contrib/' it'll download the whole set again. Improve it
and share your receipe :)

Most of the 'depends' was mentioned just for reference
and will be automagically** downloaded and sorted out.

Thanks.
