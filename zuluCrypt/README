zulucrypt (GUI and cli frontend to cryptsetup)

zuluCrypt is a front end to cryptsetup. It makes it easy to use 
cryptsetup to manage encrypted  volumes by providing a Qt based 
GUI and a simpler to use cli front end to  cryptsetup.  It does
the same thing  truecrypt does  but  uses  (through cryptsetup)
cryptographic  infrastructure  that  exist inside the kernel in
linux and some bsd systems.
