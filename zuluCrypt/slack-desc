# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zulucrypt: zulucrypt (GUI and cli frontend to cryptsetup)
zulucrypt:
zulucrypt: zuluCrypt is a front end to cryptsetup. It makes it easy to use 
zulucrypt: cryptsetup to manage encrypted  volumes by providing a Qt based
zulucrypt: GUI and a simpler to use cli front end to  cryptsetup.  It does
zulucrypt: the same thing  truecrypt does  but  uses  (through cryptsetup)
zulucrypt: cryptographic  infrastructure  that  exist inside the kernel in
zulucrypt: linux and some bsd systems.
