TrueCrypt

TrueCrypt is software for establishing and  maintaining an on-the-fly
encrypted volume  (data storage device).  On-the-fly encryption means
that  data is  automatically  encrypted  right before it is saved and
decrypted  right after it is loaded,  without any  user intervention.
No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without
using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys.
