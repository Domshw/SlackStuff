# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following  the base package name,  and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary
# to leave one space after the ':'.

truecrypt: truecrypt (On-the-fly volume encryption)
truecrypt:
truecrypt: TrueCrypt is software for establishing and  maintaining an on-the-fly
truecrypt: encrypted volume  (data storage device).  On-the-fly encryption means
truecrypt: that  data is  automatically  encrypted  right before it is saved and
truecrypt: decrypted  right after it is loaded,  without any  user intervention.
truecrypt: No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without
truecrypt: using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys.
